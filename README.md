# Moustache Republic

For my submission I've used Vite (react with typescript) as my project starter.
I decided to handle styling with Tailwind, so I also utilized Shadcn to make use of a couple of Shadcn components (dropdown, button and input field). Shadcn also bundles lucide react so I could easily import a shopping cart icon.

I did setup react-router-dom as I wasn't sure if this was going to be necessary later on in the brief based on misunderstanding what was meant by multiple pages (react-router-dom was entirely unnecessary).

The time spent on this project has crossed the 4 hour mark so I'm submitting without finishing everything. The styling is not identical to the brief (notably some different colors/fonts + dropdown styling). Additionally, the styling could be cleaned up a fair bit (i.e I've specified colors with tailwind classes inline in some instances, these should be specified in my tailwind config or use css for a default site style). Functionally, I'm not handling adding quantity within the cart properly (ran out of time) and the 'size not selected' alert could easily be replaced with another component to be prettier.
