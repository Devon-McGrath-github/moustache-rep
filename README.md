# Moustache Republic

For my submission I've used Vite (react with typescript) as my project starter.
I decided to handle styling with Tailwind, so I also utilized Shadcn to make use of a couple of Shadcn components (dropdown, button and input field). Shadcn also bundles lucide react so I could easily import a shopping cart icon.

I did setup react-router-dom as I wasn't sure if this was going to be necessary later on in the brief based on misunderstanding what was meant by multiple pages (react-router-dom was entirely unnecessary).

The time spent on this project was around the 4 hour mark so I'm submitting without finishing the styling/responsiveness 100% to the brief.
